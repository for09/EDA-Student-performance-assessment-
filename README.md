# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis using Python (EDA & Visualization)

## 📄 Overview
This project performs a detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a student performance dataset to identify factors influencing academic outcomes.  
The dataset includes demographic attributes, parental education levels, lunch types, test preparation status, and performance scores in **Math, Reading, and Writing**.  

Using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, the analysis investigates correlations, categorical distributions, and performance trends across multiple attributes.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Techniques:** Data Cleaning, Statistical Analysis, Feature Visualization, Outlier Detection, Correlation Mapping  

---

## 🧼 Data Preprocessing & Transformation
- Checked and handled **missing values, duplicates, and data type inconsistencies**  
- Converted categorical variables for visualization and correlation analysis  
- Generated summary statistics and unique value counts for each attribute

## 📊 Analysis & Visualization
- **Univariate Analysis:** Explored distributions of categorical and numerical features  
- **Bivariate Analysis:** Compared performance metrics (math, reading, writing) against demographic and socio-economic features  
- **Multivariate Analysis:** Utilized pairplots and pie charts to understand interrelationships among multiple variables  
- **Outlier Detection:** Employed boxplots to identify score anomalies and data deviations

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Students who **completed test preparation courses** consistently outperformed those who didn’t.  
- **Parental education level** and **lunch type** showed significant influence on overall test scores.  
- **Gender differences** were evident in writing vs. math scores, highlighting subject-based performance trends.
