Exploring Student datadet containing attributes as given below:

* gender: sex of student (male/female)
* race/ethnicity: ethnicity of student (Group A,B,C,D,E)
* parental level of education: parents' final education (bachelor's degree,some collefe,master's degree,assocaition.s degree,high school)
* lunch: having lunch before test(standard or free/reduced)
* test preparation course: complete or not complete before test
 math score
* reading score
* writing score

In this EDA Different checks run on dataset are:

* missing values
* duplicate values
* data types
* number of unique vlaues of each column
* statistics of dataset
* various categories present in the different categorical column 

This is followed by transforming data into the needed form and visualizing distribution of data

* Multivariate analysis using pieplot is performed to display relative percentage od diffrent attributes

Feature wise visualization is performed using:

* Univariate analysis (Ex. How is distribution of Gender)
* Bivariate analysis (Ex. Does Gender has any impact on student's performance)
 
 
Check for outliers is performed using boxplot 


 It is followed by,
 
 * Multivariate analysis using pairplot 
 
 
 Finally conclusion is included to summarize all the useful findings.
